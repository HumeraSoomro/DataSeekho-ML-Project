# DataSeekho-ML-Project

This repository showcases my very first Machine Learning project, completed as part of DataSeekho's insightful ML Bootcamp. DataSeekho is a valuable platform that empowers individuals in the field of data science. Throughout the bootcamp, I delved into the fascinating world of predictive analysis and model building.This project demonstrates my newly acquired skills, including data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, and the implementation of various machine learning models. It systematically covers the essential steps of the data science workflow, from library importation and data preprocessing to model predictions.This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to building predictive models and showcases my ability to clean and analyze data, uncover insights, and implement ML models for meaningful predictions.
